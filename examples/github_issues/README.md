The models package was generated by running:

```shell script
qbc run model-generate -a https://builderprogram-tkutcher.quickbase.com/db/bqyhichwa
```

Then adding a custom `__str__` method in the generated GitHubIssue class.

From this directory, running `example_post_all.py` would add records to QuickBase for each 
issue in GitHub.

Running `example_queries.py` highlights then running some queries against that data.
